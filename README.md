# TuringMachine
A simple simulation of an turing machine with one tape. The program has an gui which allows the definition of rules and the input of the tape. It can either run a single step algorithm or an fully automatic algorythm until a stop-command is called. The programm allows the commands left, right, star, one, stop or goTo. 

The program is written in Java with a mix of english and german speech, this is going to be changed. The UI is currently also fully in german but this is also going to change.
